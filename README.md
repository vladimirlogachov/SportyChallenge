# SportyChallenge

### AI tools
* Ulla OpenWeather AI assistant - to choose proper endpoint
* ChatGPT - to generate remote scheme and domain models 
* Gemini - for code auto completion

### Notes
 - Uses `/data/2.5/forecast` free plan endpoint so it's actually 5 day / 3 hour forecast data
 - Use cases / interactors omitted for the sake of simplicity, ideally we would have them.
 - I've omitted tests due to lack of time. If you interested in how I write tests, you can
check out my pet project https://github.com/vladimirlogachov/MoviesPot/ there are plenty of them.
 - Permissions check part was copy pasted from [here](https://github.com/android/platform-samples/blob/main/shared/src/main/java/com/example/platform/shared/PermissionBox.kt)
to simply save time, so it's not a production ready solution.
